# ML Olympiad - Sustainable Urban Living

## Overview
This repository contains my submission for the ML Olympiad - Sustainable Urban Living Kaggle competition. The competition aimed to predict the habitability score of properties using AI models. Participants were tasked with developing machine learning algorithms capable of accurately assessing the suitability of urban living spaces, contributing to sustainable urban development initiatives.

## Competition Details
- **Competition Name:** ML Olympiad - Sustainable Urban Living
- **Kaggle Link:** [ML Olympiad - Sustainable Urban Living](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ml-olympiad-sustainable-urban-living/data)
- **Rank:** 19 out of 122 teams

## Approach

- **Data Analysis:** Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset, identify trends, and understand the features' distributions.
- **Feature Engineering:** Engineered relevant features to enhance the predictive power of the models, leveraging domain knowledge and data preprocessing techniques.
- **Model Selection:** Explored various machine learning algorithms, including regression and ensemble methods, to build predictive models with high accuracy and generalization capability.
